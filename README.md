Animation, Images, Audio and Web

The animation is going to be focused on strips of randomness from my college experience so far, with a floating head next to each thing/person/place. I’ll use images for the places and I will draw some of the objects. . 

I want to convey a feeling of calmness.

A max of 7 images should be enough for what I’m trying to do here. It should be about a minute, so not too long. There’s going to be 2 audio tracks; one with my voice talking, and another with some calm background music playing.

I’ll be looking for images that match with these places/things/people for the purpose of showing people my random experiences during my first semester.

Guess I’ll have to use After Effects, Github, Photoshop and Audacity.
